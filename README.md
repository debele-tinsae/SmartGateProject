# SmartGateProject


This project implements a License plate image recognition system for a garage. 

The car approachs the garage are spotted by the sensors using the ardiuno code.

the camera captures an image from the raspberry pi image capturing code.

This picture is sent with TCP code to a Server (a laptop).

This server has an alogrithm code to change the PNG captured image into a string to be compared to a database.

The andriod App has a login and registration activities to add license plates to the system related to a specific user "SMART gate", also adding up to 5 guests.

the adding to the database code is included. 

Checking if the license plate exists algorithm is included. 

sending using UDP code to different parts of the system is included.

The final Arduino code used for the demo is called FinalArduinoUsedForDemo.ino by Abdelrahman Darwish
